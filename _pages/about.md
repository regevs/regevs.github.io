I completed my PhD at the Computer Science department of Tel-Aviv University under the supervision of Prof. Eran Halperin. I was a research scientist and a team leader at MyHeritage. 

I am now a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, with Prof. Richard Durbin.

I was a TA in Intro to Machine Learning in 2016/2017, 2015/2016, and 2014/2015.

I am interested in so and so.
