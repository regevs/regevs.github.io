Starting Oct 2025, I will be a PI at the [Gray Faculty of Medicine](https://en-med.tau.ac.il/) and the [Blavatnik School of Computer Science & AI](https://en-exact-sciences.tau.ac.il/computer) at Tel Aviv University.

I am currently the Director of Science at [MyHeritage](http://myheritage.com/).

Before, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, with [Prof. Richard Durbin](https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/research-groups/research-groups/durbin). I completed my PhD at the Computer Science department of Tel-Aviv University under the supervision of Prof. Eran Halperin; and my M.Sc with Prof. Michal Linial and Prof. Nati Linial at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

I am also currently consulting to several biotech companies in subjects of data analysis, modeling and genetics.

I am interested in various aspects of statistical and population genetics, and the power they give us to understand our present and our past. Specifically:
- Theory and methods development, both from a classical model-based approach (coalescent theory etc.) and modern machine-learning methodologies
- Data analysis of mutations and recombinations, to understand the molecular mechanisms and patterns underlying genetic inheritance and disease
- Applications across various domains, such as demography inference, evolution, detecting selection, phylodynamics of pathogens, and more
- Analysis and applications of long-read sequencing technology
